# scene-graph-builder

Here is a library to build a [scene graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) from a JSON specification. This document will explain how to build such a graph along with the syntax that should be followed when building the JSON file.

## Reminders
The file with the code of the library is: **libs/sg-builder.js** which uses functions from the file **lib/MV.js**. All the other files are here for the sake of demonstration of the library usage. I also wanted to mention the majority of the files are from the [Computer Graphis and Interface course](https://guia.unl.pt/en/2022/fct/program/1053/course/8150) I took at [NSST](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en).
